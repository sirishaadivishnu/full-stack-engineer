# Programming Language: HTML, CSS & Javascript

This repository contains the programs that I wrote during my traineeship as a full stack developer. These programs cover HTML, CSS & Javascript.

## Getting Started

To run these programs, you'll need to have a browser and java installed on your computer.

You can clone this repository using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/sirishaadivishnu/full-stack-engineer.git
```

## Directory Structure

The repository doesn't contain any typical directory structure however, there is a corresponding javascript and a css file for each html program. At the end of this Readme.md I have created a table to describe each program in the repository.

## Contributing

If you find any bugs or issues in the programs, please feel free to create an issue or submit a pull request.

Happy coding!
